Information about Linux and open source abounds on the internet, but when you're entrenched in your work there's often a need for quick documentation. Since the early days of Unix, well before Linux even existed, there's been the `man` (short for "manual") and `info` commands, both of which display official project documentation about commands, configuration files, system calls, and more.

There's a debate over whether `man` and `info` pages are meant as helpful reminders for users who already know how to use a tool, or an intro for first time users. Either way, both `man` and `info` pages describe tools and how to use them, and rarely address specific tasks and how to accomplish them. It's for that very reason that the `cheat` command was developed.
